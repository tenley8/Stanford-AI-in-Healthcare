## Stanford AI in Healthcare
#### Stanford University School Of Medicine: [Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare](https://online.stanford.edu/programs/artificial-intelligence-healthcare):
### About this Professional Certificate 
Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed industries around the world, and has the potential to radically alter the field of healthcare. Imagine being able to analyze data on patient visits to the clinic, medications prescribed, lab tests, and procedures performed, as well as data outside the health system -- such as social media, purchases made using credit cards, census records, Internet search activity logs that contain valuable health information, and you’ll get a sense of how AI could transform patient care and diagnoses. In this specialization, we'll discuss the current and future applications of AI in healthcare with the goal of learning to bring AI technologies into the clinic safely and ethically. This specialization is designed for both healthcare providers and computer science professionals, offering insights to facilitate collaboration between the disciplines.

    Identify problems healthcare providers face that machine learning can solve
    Analyze how AI affects patient care safety, quality, and research
    Relate AI to the science, practice, and business of medicine
    Apply the building blocks of AI to help you innovate and understand emerging technologies

### Courses
#### Introduction to Healthcare:
[Course Code: SOM-XCHE0008](https://online.stanford.edu/courses/som-xche0008-introduction-healthcare):
From increasing costs of care to high medication errors, the U.S. healthcare system’s problems and challenges are complex. To improve the American healthcare system, you need to be aware and considerate of the system’s current realities. In this course, you’ll learn about everything from which institutions and participants are interacting in the healthcare system and how physicians, hospitals, and insurance companies work together for patient care and finances. By gaining knowledge on cost management, quality of care, and accessibility, you’ll be better equipped to identify why we have our current problems and see how they can connect to future potential solutions.

    Understand issues in improving healthcare delivery and the healthcare system
    Identify key stakeholders in the U.S. healthcare system

#### Introduction to Clinical Data:
[Course Code: SOM-XCHE0009](https://online.stanford.edu/courses/som-xche0009-introduction-clinical-data):
From identifying treatment plans and improving patient outcomes to more affordable healthcare costs, clinical data mining can be a key component in driving broad systemic improvements in healthcare. As clinical data mining is refined and implemented, we need to understand what ethical and legal concerns could arise when integrating patient information into the healthcare landscape. In this course, you’ll learn a framework for successful and ethical data mining to be able to improve and innovate the healthcare industry.

    Apply a framework for medical data mining
    Consider the ethical use of data in healthcare decisions
    Make use of data that may be inaccurate in systematic ways
    Recognize what makes a good research question and construct a data mining workflow answer it

#### Fundamental of Machine Learning for Healthcare:
[Course Code: SOM-XCHE0010](https://online.stanford.edu/courses/som-xche0011-evaluations-ai-applications-healthcare):
Artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare can improve patient care, enhance quality of life, and lead to better discoveries in research, and explore new solutions to diseases. This course dives into the downstream effects of AI healthcare solutions and looks at the opportunities and challenges that are present with its usage. By understanding its benefits and limitations, you can be better prepared for real-world clinical application.

    Integrate AI into clinical workflows using the principles and the practical considerations learned in this course
    Apply best practices of AI applications to promote fair and equitable healthcare solutions
    Understand the challenges of regulation of AI applications and which components of a model can be regulated
    Recognize what standard evaluation metrics do and do not provide

####  Evaluations of AI Applications in Healthcare:

#### AI in Healthcare Capstone:
[Course Code: SOM-XCHE0012](https://online.stanford.edu/courses/som-xche0012-ai-healthcare-capstone):
When a person develops respiratory symptoms and suspects COVID-19, what do they do? In situations such as that, how can the availability of data and its specific usage affect the diagnosis, treatment, and overall patient journey? In the capstone project, you will take a guided, interactive tour through the patient journey to see how different decisions can create different datasets and outcomes, and how regulatory and ethical limitations affect its process. With hands-on experience in the position of a medical data miner, you’ll see how data has the power to transform patient care
