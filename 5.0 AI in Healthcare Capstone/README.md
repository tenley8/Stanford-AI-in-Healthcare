### Stanford AI in Healthcare Specialization Capstone Project
[Course Code: SOM-XCHE0012](https://online.stanford.edu/courses/som-xche0012-ai-healthcare-capstone):
When a person develops respiratory symptoms and suspects COVID-19, what do they do? In situations such as that, how can the availability of data and its specific usage affect the diagnosis, treatment, and overall patient journey? 
#### AI in Healthcare Capstone:
This capstone project takes you on a guided tour exploring all the concepts we have covered in the different classes up till now. 
We have organized this experience around the journey of a patient who develops some respiratory symptoms and given the concerns around COVID19 seeks care with a primary care provider. We will follow the patient's journey from the lens of the data that are created at each encounter, which will bring us to a unique de-identified dataset created especially for this specialization. 
The data set spans EHR as well as image data and using this dataset, we will build models that enable risk-stratification decisions for our patient. We will review how the different choices you make -- such as those around feature construction, the data types to use, how the model evaluation is set up and how you handle the patient timeline -- affect the care that would be recommended by the model. 
During this exploration, we will also discuss the regulatory as well as ethical issues that come up as we attempt to use AI to help us make better care decisions for our patient. This course will be a hands-on experience in the day of a medical data miner.
